# Introduction

These are my personal hacked-up VIM settings/plugins.

# Setup
Create a symbolic link to the ```vimrc``` file in your home directory (or wherever VIM expects it):

```$ ln -s vimrc ~/.vimrc ```

Clone the most recent [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) in ```./bundle/```:

```$ git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim```
